Explore the possibility of scraping all Wikipedia pages pertaining to a particular topic instead of scraping a specific page 
specified by the user through command-line input. This would involve:

    Identifying a specific topic or category of interest on Wikipedia.

    Retrieving a list of all Wikipedia pages related to that topic or category using Wikipedia's API or other available sources.

    Iterating through the list of pages and scraping data from each page using the existing scraping logic.
    
    Saving the scraped data from each page to a database or files for further analysis.

Considerations:

    Topic Selection: Choose a topic or category that is well-defined and relevant to the project's goals.

    Data Processing: Develop a strategy for handling large volumes of data obtained from scraping multiple
     =pages, including data storage, cleaning, and preprocessing.

    API Usage: Ensure compliance with Wikipedia's API usage policies and guidelines to avoid overloading 
    their servers or violating terms of service.

    Data Quality: Evaluate the quality and relevance of the scraped data to ensure its suitability for analysis or processing.

    Performance: Optimize the scraping process for efficiency and scalability, considering factors such as network latency, 
    page load times, and resource consumption.

Benefits:

    Comprehensive Data: Scraping all Wikipedia pages related to a specific topic provides a comprehensive dataset for analysis,
    allowing for a more thorough exploration of the subject matter.

    Insight Discovery: By analyzing a diverse range of pages, it may be possible to uncover new insights, patterns, or relationships within the data.
    Enhanced Research: The scraped data can serve as a valuable resource for research, education, or other applications related to the chosen topic.

Challenges:

    Data Volume: Scraping multiple Wikipedia pages can result in a large volume of data, requiring careful management and processing
    to extract meaningful insights.

    Data Quality Assurance: Ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and relevance of the scraped data may pose challenges, especially 
    when dealing with diverse content and varying page structures.

    Resource Constraints: Managing resources such as bandwidth, storage, and computational power is essential, particularly when 
    scraping a large number of pages or dealing with high traffic volumes.

    API Limitations: Adhering to API rate limits and usage restrictions imposed by Wikipedia or other relevant sources is critical 
    to avoid service disruptions or account suspensions.
