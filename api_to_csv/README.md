# Web Data Extraction Script

This Python script extracts data from a web API and saves it to a CSV file. It utilizes the `requests` library to make HTTP requests and `pandas` to handle and manipulate data.

## Usage

1. **Dependencies Installation**: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Install the required dependencies using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install requests pandas
    ```

2. **Running the Script**: Open the Python script (`script.py`) in your preferred editor and modify the `url` variable to the desired API endpoint. You may also adjust the `headers` dictionary to match the required headers for the API request.

3. Execute the script by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    python script.py
    ```

    The script will make a GET request to the specified URL with the provided headers. If the response status code is 200 (OK), it will extract the JSON data, convert it to a Pandas DataFrame, and save it to a CSV file named `data.csv` in the current directory.

## Script Breakdown

- **URL**: The URL variable (`url`) specifies the endpoint from which data will be retrieved.
- **Headers**: The `headers` dictionary contains the required HTTP headers for the request, including the user agent, referer, and others.
- **Request Handling**: The script uses the `requests` library to make a GET request to the specified URL with the provided headers.
- **Data Processing**: If the response status code is 200, indicating success, the script extracts the JSON data and normalizes it into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **CSV Export**: The script saves the extracted data to a CSV file named `data.csv` in the current directory.

## Error Handling

If the script encounters an error (e.g., non-200 response status code), it will print an error message indicating the failure to retrieve data along with the corresponding HTTP status code.

## Note

Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access the API endpoint specified in the `url` variable. Additionally, verify that the headers provided in the `headers` dictionary are accurate and up-to-date.
